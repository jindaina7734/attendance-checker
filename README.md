# Attendance Checker
Computer Vision Project for Attendance Checking

## I. Introduction
Face recognition attendance checker is a technology that uses facial recognition to track employee attendance. It is more accurate, efficient, secure, and cost-effective than traditional attendance tracking methods. It can help to reduce time theft, improve employee morale, and provide insights into employee productivity.

## II. About the project
In this project, I applied face_recognition - a pre-trained model that can make recognition much easier based on its one-shot learning algorithm. You can check out this site: https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition

The model has an interface built using the Tkinter library. It allows us to practice with the CSV file in real time (update and remove values continuously). With a friendly, easy-to-use interface, attendance management will become more efficient.

## III. Installation: 
### 1. Requirement libraries:
First, we have to install these libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install opencv-python
pip install Pillow

pip install cmake
pip install dlib
pip install face_recognition
```
### 2. After that:
Run the ```fasys.py``` and then run.
